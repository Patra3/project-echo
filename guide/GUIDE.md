## Project Echo guide  

Thank you for using Project Echo! This web app is a todo list with many advanced features. Currently it is free for use while in development. Features may change rapidly as I continue to work on the project.

Let's get started using this app. I encourage you to read the guide and then experiment with these features as you see fit, to better understand them.

#### Task View  <a name="task-view"></a>
[#](#ct)
This is the screen you will see when you first log into Project Echo:  

![t1](guide/guide1.png)  

This is the Task View, where you will see all of your tasks you or others have 
created. Let's try **creating a new Task** ourselves, by pressing the blue "New task" button:  

![t2](guide/guide2.png)  

Now you will see the Task Editor pop up. You can use the task editor to create a new task. Here, you can set: 
- The task name
- A description for your task (supports [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/))
- A due date for your task
- Task tags (see Tasks section)
- Task priority (how important is this task)
- and you can upload attachments  

When you are all finished, you can press the blue "Create task" button to finish.  

![t3](guide/guide3.png)  

Your task should show up here in the menu. Here I have created a new task "Shop for groceries" as an example.  

You can press on the yellow circle to **mark a task as completed**. Let's try that too.  

![t4](guide/guide4.png)  

*Where did our task go?* Press on Apply Filter button, and select the option "Show completed".  

![t5](guide/guide5.png)  

There we go. Now we can see all completed tasks as well. **If you want to hide completed tasks again, just uncheck the option "Show completed".**  

You can see some other buttons near the top right of the task as well.
- The first button is the edit button, pressing it will allow you to edit the task again.  
- The green button is the download button if you uploaded attachments.  
- The red button is the delete button, to permanently delete this task.  

Finally, you can also click on the green checkmark to **unmark a task as completed**.  

I recommend experimenting with these buttons for youself to get an idea.  

To get back to this home screen, **press the logo or the home button at the bottom right**.

#### Filters View  <a name="filters"></a>
[#](#ct)
What if we created a LOT of tasks? Sometimes there are too many things on the screen, and we only want to see a FEW of them! We can use "filters" for this.  

A filter lets you see only tasks that meet certain criteria that you can set.
For example, you can set it so that you can only see tasks with "Shopping" or "HW" in the title, or description. Let's see how it works.  

First, press the Green button from Task View, which says "Create Filter":  

![t6](guide/guide6.png)  

Everyone (including you) will start out with the "Default" filter. This filter groups tasks by day, and sorts them by their title alphabetically. You can edit the Default filter, or **make a new filter by pressing "Select a filter to edit or add", and pressing "Add new filter"**.   

    
<br>

Here are some information:  
###### Filter name  
Here you can change the name of the filter  
###### Include Tags  
Here you can select which tags you wish to see. Only tasks which have these tags will show up (see tags section).  
###### Group by  
For your convenience, you can select how to group tasks together in your task view.
###### Sort by  
For your convenience, you can select how to sort tasks within each group.  
###### Description includes  
Only tasks which have the content you enter in it's description, will appear. Keep in mind that it is case sensitive, and exact.
###### Title includes  
Only tasks which have the content you enter in it's title, will appear. Keep in mind that it is case sensitive, and exact.  
###### Start & End Dates  
Specify the start and end date ranges. Only tasks that have their due dates/creation date in this range will show up.  
<br><br>
After you have finished making changes, you can click "Confirm" to save the changes. If you were making a new filter, it will now show up in the list as well.  

The red button "Delete filter" will delete the filter you are currently editing.  

<br><hr>
#### Applying filter  <a name="applying-filter"></a>
[#](#ct)
Applying a filter is easy,  

![t10](guide/guide10.png)  

you can select a filter from this dropdown where we found "Show completed" earlier. Changes will automatically apply.

<br><hr>
#### Tags  <a name="tags"></a>
[#](#ct)
Tags are a very useful organization tool for your convenience. You can attach tags to any tasks.  

You can think of tags as labels for each task, allowing you to categorize them. Let's see with an example.  
From My Tasks, press the "Create Tag" button.  

![t7](guide/guide7.png)  

This is the tag editor. You can see that currently, we have no tags. I am going to create one as you can see. Feel free to play with this as well, you can add a tag name, and select its color. **Press Create tag to finish**.  

![t8](guide/guide8.png)  

Your new tag should show up similar to this. Click on a tag to edit or delete it.  

The big red button allows you to delete every tag, this is very dangerous (you cannot recover it) so please be careful.  

![t9](guide/guide9.png)  

You may also note that if you edit or create a new task, your tags will show up as well and you can select them. Same thing will happen in the filter view that we mentioned earlier.  

<br><hr>
#### Vaults  <a name="vaultst"></a>
[#](#ct)
You can think of vaults as lockers that store everything we mentioned earlier. They store tasks, all the tags, filters, and content separately. You start with a default vault called "Personal Vault", and you can create more vaults as you like.  
For example, you could create a Home vault, a Work vault, and a School vault.  

![t11](guide/guide11.png)  

To get to vaults, from My Tasks **press the "View Vaults" button**.  

The blue "Create new vault" button will let you create a new vault.  

You can also a "View Members" button, let's press it.  

![t12](guide/guide12.png)  

Here you can see all the people that can view/edit your vault. There is also a green "Invite person" button, so you can allow other users of this app to collaborate with you in your vault.  

You will need to enter their [user code](#usercode) (aka share code).  

<br><hr>
#### Your Account  <a name="account"></a>  
[#](#ct) Here you can edit your account. To get to this screen, from My Tasks, press your profile icon located at the top right corner of the screen.  

![t14](guide/guide14.png)  


You can change your profile picture, username (which shows up to other users), and password.  

<a name="usercode"></a>
**And, you can copy your user code by clicking the black button.**  

  
*Please note: It is dangerous to give this away to people you don't trust. Anyone can add you to their vaults if they have your user code. Treat this as valuable and only share it to people you trust.*
